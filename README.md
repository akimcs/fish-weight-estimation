# fish-weight-estimation

## Description:
A Python project that uses machine learning to estimate the weight of a fish.

A linear regression model is trained using existing data. The user inputs five length measurements of a fish and the application outputs the predicted weight of the fish. 

**Features:**
* the ability to input a fish's vertical length, diagonal length, cross length, height, and diagonal width and receive its predicted weight in grams. 
* generation of visuals that show and/or describe the data and algorithm.
